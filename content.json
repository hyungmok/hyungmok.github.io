Also, we're gonna use Jest and Enzyme for the TDD. Upon completion, you will be able to: create Epics, User Stories based on the requirement create tests based on User Stories to develop a React app using TDD use Enzyme and Jest to test a React app use/reuse CSS variables for responsive design create a reusable React component that renders and functions differently based on the provided props type check component props using React PropTypes I assumed that you have basic knowledge of React at least. If you’re completely new to React, I’d recommend you to complete the offical https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html tutorial. ContentsOverview We'll be building a basic pomodoro timer app consisting of some UI components. Each component will have a separate set of tests in a corresponding test file. First of all, we could create Epics, User Stories as follows based on the project requirement. Epic: As a user, I need to use the timer so that I can manage my time. User Story: As a user, I need to start the timer so that I can count down my time. Acceptance Criteria: Ensure the user is able to: start the timer see the timer start counting down User Story: As a user, I need to stop the timer so that I can count down my time only when needed.Acceptance Criteria: Ensure the user is able to: stop the timer see the timer stopped","link":"/2020/05/15/tdd-with-react/"}],"tags":[{"name":"TDD","slug":"TDD","link":"/tags/TDD/"},{"name":"React","slug":"React","link":"/tags/React/"},{"name":"Jest","slug":"Jest","link":"/tags/Jest/"},{"name":"Enzyme","slug":"Enzyme","link":"/tags/Enzyme/"}],"categories":[{"name":"Development","slug":"Development","link":"/categories/Development/"}]}
